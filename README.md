- 👋 Hi, I’m Felix
- 💼 I'm a PhD student at the Oxford Internet Institute, after formerly working as a senior analytics consultant at QuantumBlack and McKinsey.
- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning in healthcare and medicine.
- 👀 I’m interested in improving multimodal approaches and making models "safer".
- 🔭 I’m looking into either using interpretable imaging models or how we can make black boxes robust towards biased data (the whole fairness discussion without actually thinking about concrete groups). 
- 💻 I'm also interested in contributing to open source 🐍 Python projects.
- 📫 How to reach me: https://www.felixkrones.de
